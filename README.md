# Image uploader

## About

This is my image uploader service.

## Features

- Upload images
- Users, authentication, signup, etc
- Following, unfollowing
- Newsfeed of images of people you're following
- View images posted by specific user
- Thumbnails generated by background Resque tasks

## Get started

- `brew install redis`
- `bundle install --without production && rake db:migrate`
- Create a config/secrets.yml the following contents and your own keys. Generate new keys with `rails secret`:

```
development:
  secret_key_base: 3b406be...
test:
  secret_key_base: 62969ff...
production:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>
```

Run tests with:

`rake`

Load server with:

`rails server` and then separately `open http://localhost:3000`

Start the thumbnail background thread in another thread with:

`RAILS_ENV=production rake resque:work QUEUE=* BACKGROUND=YES` and `redis-server`

## Eventual roadmap:

- ~~Index page with thumbnails created by worker tasks~~
- ~~Users~~
- ~~Following~~
- ~~Newsfeed~~
- Likes/comments
